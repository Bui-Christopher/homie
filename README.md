![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Bui-Christopher/homie/main)

## Description
Homie aims to display visual representations of datasets related to the housing market. It answers two vital questions:
- What is the value of a home in a given region/date?
- What is the value of a mortgage interest rate at a given date?

Current datasets include Zillow, FHFA, Fed Treasury, and Huduser.
