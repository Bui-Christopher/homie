## Description üí°
Homie aims to display visualizations of housing market datasets.

It answers two vital questions:
- What value of a home is fair? üí∞
- What value of a mortgage interest rate is fair? üìà

Current datasets include [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx), [Fed Treasury](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/), and Huduser.

## Quick Start ‚ö°
### Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

### Running
```
./scripts/local_dev.sh
```
This script will pull and run the required images. It will locally deploy with a database, backend, and frontend.
Please check http://localhost:3000.
