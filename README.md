## Description üí°
Homie aims to display visualizations of housing market datasets.

It answers two vital questions:
1. What value of a home is fair? üí∞
2. What value of a mortgage interest rate is fair? üìà

The technology stack was chosen by stacks I'm unfamiliar or interested in.

##### homie-api
This service hosts an HTTP API which reads and serves the dataset to the end user. I had not created HTTP servers with `axum` before, thus it was chosen.
Additionally, the focus was to extend its basic handlers with custom errors and extractors.

##### homie-core
This library's focus was to design the application with a `Hexagonal Architecture` approach. It has two main modules: adapters and domain.
The repository adapter has been abstracted to be capable of utilizing and database.

##### homie-data
This service reads CSV data and writes to an SQL database. Most of my experience is with NoSQL and Key-Value stores. Thus, I chose `SQLx` and `PostgreSQL`.
It has flexible configurations, and writes in accordance to its environment variables.

##### homie-webapp
This service will run server-sided-rendering (SSR) application for the end users. I have very little front end experience, and wanted to develop it entirely in Rust and chose the `Leptos` framework.
It is served as a WASM binary and utilizes `plotly` for interactive visualizations.

##### Datasets
Current datasets include [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/), [FHFA](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx), [Fed Treasury](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/), and Huduser.
The datasets are publicly available, downloaded and stored into Postgres. Zillow's public [API](https://www.zillowgroup.com/developers/) key can be requested for up to date information; however, their terms of service state that it cannot be stored into a database.

## Quick Start ‚ö°
### Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have Docker installed and running. Also, install jq to run the bash script tests.

### Running
```
./local/run.sh
./local/test.sh
```
This script will pull and run the required images. It will locally deploy with a database, backend, and frontend.
Please check http://localhost:3000.
